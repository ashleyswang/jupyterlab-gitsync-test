Plain Text Collaboration Test

=======================================================================

PART I: EDITS WITHOUT CONFLICTS

Purpose: In this section we test how edits show up when two users are 
working on different parts of the same file. Edits from one user should
not overlap into the other user's. 

Expected Behavior: There should be no conflict error messages while
working on this section. If there is, click on the "View Diff" option
in the pop-up and note the conflict in the bug-bash spreadsheet. 
(Providing a screenshot is preferable).

Instructions*: Working with a partner fill in the following information 
about both testers. Please designate who will be Tester A and who will
be Tester B. In the "About Me" section, tell me something interesting 
about yourself. This section should be 5-10 sentences long. After 
completing the task, take a note of about how long it took before changes
from your partner were displayed onto the screen. 

***** TESTER A *****
Name: 
LDAP: 

About Me:

Approx. Time: 
********************

***** TESTER B *****

PART II: EDITS WITH CONFLICTS

Purpose: In this section we test how edits show up when two users are 
working on the same file and the changes conflict. 

Expected Behavior: There should be no other popups besides a Conflict
Error pop-up. If other errors arise, please note the pop-up in the 
bug-bash spreadsheet. (Providing a screenshot is preferable).

Instructions*: Below are 3 sets of 5 words with missing characters. 
Using the list of words located in your instruction set, figure out the 
correct word that matches the format and write it next to the arrow. At 
the end of each section, wait for a Conflict Error to appear and choose 
the option in the section title and ensure the editor contents are correct.

SECTION A: VIEW DIFF AFTER CONFLICT
Check for: 
- Conflict markers  : ">>>>>>>> LOCAL", "========", "<<<<<<<< REMOTE"
- Local/remote edits: ensure that both you and your partner's edits
                      are shown in the diff

Check for:

               the content before the pop-up
