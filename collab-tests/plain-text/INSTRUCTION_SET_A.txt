Plain Text Collaboration | Tester A Instructions

=======================================================================

PART I: DISJOINT EDITS

Instructions: Follow the instructions located in the template. 

=======================================================================

PART II: INTEGRATED EDITS W/O CONFLICTS

Instructions: In the template, there are 10 sets of 5 binary digits.
For each set, your goal is to communicate whether or not each of the 
attributes are true or false. The possible attributes are [red, blue, 
star, light]. 

1. To determine the placement of the attribute indicators, count the 
number of 1's in the individual set or sum up the digits in the set. 
Then the order of the attributes are as follows:

    SUM            ATTRIBUTE ORDER
    0              star   red    light  blue
    1              red    star   blue   light
    2              blue   star   red    light
    3              star   light  red    blue
    4              blue   red    light  star
    5              light  star   blue   red

2. Then using the first 4 binary digits, determine whether each
corresponding attribute is true or false (0 indicates false and 1 
indicates true). Communicate with your partner via the text editor 
the attributes of the set. 

EXAMPLE: 01001

    1. There are two 1's in the set, so the order of attributes is 
       [blue, star, red, light].
    2. The first digit is 0, so the first attribute, blue, is false. The 
       second digit is 1, so the second attribute, star, is true. Continue 
       with the remaining attributes, so we know that this set only has 
       the attribute [star].
    3. In the working document, we list the attributes next to the set and 
       let Tester B get the final answer. 
       
       01001  => [star] 
       ** TESTER B DOES THE REST **
